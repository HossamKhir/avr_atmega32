There are many reasons why sometime we prefer to use LCD in 4-bit mode instead of 8-bit. One basic reason is less number of pins are needed to interface LCD.
we only need 7 pins to interface with LCD. D4-D7 are the data pins connection and Enable, Read/Write and Register Select are for LCD control pins.
In 4-bits mode data is sent nibble by nibble, 
first we send higher nibble and then lower nibble. 
This means in both command and data sending function we need to separate the higher 4-bits and lower 4-bits, send the higher 4-bits first the lower 4-bits.
